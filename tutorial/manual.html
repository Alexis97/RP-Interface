            <h2>The data collection procedure</h2>
            <p>
                As a participant, you need to login/create an account on Mechanical Turk will log in to the site. You
                will select our task from a list of other tasks available for online “workers.” Once selected, you will
                view
                the intro/splash screen for the task that explains what should be done. If the you agrees to
                participate, you will click on a button and begin the task.
            </p>

            <p>
                You are required to read the full instruction about recurring pattern labeling task (the page you are
                currently reading), which contains
                basic description about what is recurring pattern and how to label them properly.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once started the task, you will be shown a random unlabeled image which contains one or multiple
                recurring patterns.
            </p>

            <h2>Labeling Instruction</h2>
            <p>
                By default, there will be a class label of “<b>Recurring Pattern 1</b>” which indicates the first
                recurring
                pattern to be annotated. You are requested to <b>label the contour of each instance</b> in this
                recurring pattern with <b>the polygon labeling tools on Amazon Turk</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                They could check the instruction page at any time they want, to make sure that they could label each
                object of the recurring pattern correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                After they finish the labeling for one recurring pattern, they could create a new class by click the
                button of “add” for the next group of recurring pattern they want to label. Then a new class label of
                “Recurring Pattern X” will be shown to indicates the X order of recurring pattern to be annotated.
            </p>
            <p>
                By doing this repeatedly, you could easily label all the recurring patterns in this image by
                their intuition in a short period of time. Participants will finally click the button of “submit” to
                submit the recurring pattern result data to Amazon S3 storage. The result data is composed of the source
                image reference, recurring pattern class for each object, bounding box information. It contains no
                private information about the participant him or herself.
            </p>
            <p>
                You could label any number of images depending on how much time you spend on each image, which
                could be various from images and be various from individuals.
            </p>
