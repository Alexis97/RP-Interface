            <h2> Choose the one better answer for each question below.</h2>

            <h3> Question 1: Recurring pattern is:</h3>
            <p> Answer (A): Recurring Pattern is a group of instances, that each of them looks exactly the same.</p>
            <p> Answer (B): Recurring Pattern is a group of instances, that similar yet not necessarily identical with
                each other</p>

            <h3> Question 2: Instance is (under the definition of recurring pattern):</h3>
            <p> Answer (A): Instance is a visual area which distinctive features that could be
                undoubtedly grouped or segmented together.</p>
            <p> Answer (B): Instance is a region of a semantic object, like chairs, birds, etc.</p>

            <h3> Question 3: Which of the following statement is right?</h3>
            <p> Answer (A): A Recurring Pattern can contain arbitrary number of instances (1,2,3,...)</p>
            <p> Answer (B): A Recurring Pattern contains two or more instances.</p>

            <h3> Question 4: Consider the image below, which annotation is more acceptable under our definition
                (instance labeled in <span style='color:blue'> blue</span> indicates they belong to the same recurring
                pattern)?</h3>
            <!-- two label results here -->
