            <h3> What is a Recurring Pattern?</h3>
            <p>
                A <b>Recurring Pattern (RP)</b> is an ensemble of similar yet not necessarily identical
                <b>"instances"</b> in an image.
            </p>

            <h3> What is an Instance?</h3>
            <p>
                The term of <b>"instances"</b> refers to a visual area which distinctive features that could be
                undoubtedly grouped or segmented together. Each <b>recurring pattern</b> consists of two or more similar
                instances.
            </p>

            <h3> How many Recurring Patterns can an image contains?</h3>
            <p> An image can contains one dominant recurring pattern, or multiple recurring patterns. It all depends!
            </p>

            <!-- examples show here -->

            <h3> Q: What if I find more/less Recurring Patterns then the others? Am I wrong? </h3>
            <p> A: Don't worry! The discovery of recurring pattern is totally based on <b>your own perception</b>! It is
                totally okay if you treat some instances as recurring patterns but the others do not think so. :)</p>

            <h3> Q: Can I view any arbitrary patterns as a recurring pattern?</h3>
            <p> A: No. A recurring pattern should contain some kind of similarity that shares among <b>all its
                    instances</b>. So you cannot just arbitrarily pick patterns as a recurring pattern.</p>
